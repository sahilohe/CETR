# CETR: Raising The Next Generation of Creators 🚀

**The school system was built for the Industrial Age. CETR is built for the Age of AI.**

CETR (Conjecture → Explanation → Testing → Refinement) is a learning framework that turns children from **passive consumers** of information into **active creators** of knowledge.

## 💡 Why CETR?

Most education treats children like "empty buckets" to be filled with facts. We do the opposite. We treat children as **Universal Explainers** who learn best by solving real problems and correcting their own mistakes.

*   **Stop the "Digital Distraction":** We replace addictive algorithmic feeds with a curated, offline-first digital library.
*   **Encourage Bold Thinking:** We reward children for making bold guesses (Conjectures) and then help them find the "Why" (Explanations).
*   **Reality as the Teacher:** No more "because I said so." We use experiments and logic (Testing) to let reality be the judge.

## 🔄 The 4-Step Cycle

1.  **Conjecture:** Make a bold guess.
2.  **Explanation:** Explain *why* you think it works.
3.  **Testing:** Try to prove the guess wrong.
4.  **Refinement:** Improve the idea based on what happened.

**In CETR, being wrong isn't a failure—it's the engine of learning.**
