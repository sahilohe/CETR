### What is CETR?

CETR (Conjecture → Explanation → Testing → Refinement) is a revolutionary learning framework designed for homeschooling (ages 3-14). It is built upon the robust philosophical foundations of Karl Popper's epistemology of error correction and David Deutsch's theory of knowledge creation (critical rationalism).

Unlike traditional educational models that often treat children as passive recipients of information, CETR positions them as active participants in the exhilarating process of knowledge creation. We believe that true learning flourishes through bold ideas, critical reasoning, and iterative improvement.

### The Problem We're Solving

Modern education faces a dual challenge:

1.  **The "Empty Vessel" Paradigm:** Traditional schooling often prioritizes rote memorization and passive information absorption, stifling independent thinking, error-correction skills, and creative problem-solving.
2.  **The Digital Distraction Crisis:** Today's children are constantly bombarded by algorithmic feeds, infinite scrolls, and recommendation systems designed for engagement, not deep learning. This environment leads to shortened attention spans, passive consumption, and narrowed curiosity.

### The CETR Solution: A Cycle of Discovery

CETR addresses these challenges by replacing passive learning with an active, iterative cycle:

*   **C - Conjecture:** Children are encouraged to propose bold ideas, solutions, or hypotheses, no matter how "wild" they may seem initially. Creativity is paramount.
*   **E - Explanation:** Children articulate *why* they believe their conjectures work, moving from simple description to deeper causal understanding.
*   **T - Testing:** Ideas confront reality, logic, or existing knowledge through experiments, observation, and critical examination. Reality, not adult authority, is the ultimate judge.
*   **R - Refinement:** Based on test results and discovered errors, conjectures are refined, modified, or replaced. Learning is driven by error elimination and continuous improvement.

**In CETR, being wrong is not a failure; it's the engine of learning.**

### Key Components of the CETR Ecosystem

1.  **Offline Digital Library:**
    *   A curated, distraction-free environment free from algorithms, ads, tracking, and social pressure.
    *   Includes a full offline copy of Wikipedia (Kiwix), Project Gutenberg books, curated educational YouTube videos, and various open-source creative tools (Scratch, Python, GeoGebra).
    *   **Goal:** To provide a "safe harbor" of rich, deep content that encourages intentional browsing and active exploration.

2.  **Local LLM Integration:**
    *   A privacy-preserving, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a local Large Language Model.
    *   Operates entirely offline, querying only the curated digital library.
    *   **Role:** Acts as a Socratic questioner, never giving direct answers, but instead prompting children to form their own conjectures, explanations, and test ideas.

3.  **The Facilitator's Role:**
    *   Parents and educators serve as "co-explorers," "critics of ideas" (not the child), and guides for designing tests.
    *   **Emphasis:** Asking probing questions (e.g., "Why do you think that?", "How could we test that?") rather than providing direct answers.

4.  **"Daily Spark" Feature:**
    *   A simple script that provides a daily curiosity-sparking problem or question to prompt engagement with the CETR cycle.
    *   **Goal:** To provide a consistent, gentle nudge towards active inquiry and knowledge creation.

5.  **Facilitator's Cookbook:**
    *   A practical guide for parents and educators with domain-specific question prompts, strategies for handling roadblocks, and examples of effective LLM Socratic prompting.
    *   **Goal:** To empower facilitators with the tools and techniques needed to effectively guide CETR sessions.

### Getting Started

The CETR system is designed for replication by parents and educators with minimal technical expertise. It runs on consumer hardware using open-source software. A detailed implementation guide will walk you through the setup of your offline digital library and local LLM.
