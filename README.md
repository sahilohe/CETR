# Sovereign Learning: The CETR + TCS + Edventures Ecosystem

Welcome to the future of learning. This project provides a holistic framework for raising **Universal Explainers**, children who are emotionally secure, intellectually rigorous, and physically capable of navigating an AI-driven world.

---

## The Three Pillars

1.  **CETR (Intellectual):** Conjecture, Explanation, Testing, Refinement. The engine of knowledge creation.
2.  **TCS (Moral):** Taking Children Seriously. A non-coercive philosophy based on consent and agency.
3.  **Edventures Studio (Physical):** The "Learning Village"—a community and maker-space for builder families.

## Project Structure

### 1. Philosophy
*   **[The Pitch](./1_philosophy/the_pitch.md):** Why this is the "Third Way" for modern education.
*   **[The Synthesis](./1_philosophy/the_synthesis.md):** How the three pillars create a coherent whole.
*   **[Future Proofing](./1_philosophy/future_proofing.md):** Why CETR is the ultimate insurance against AI.

### 2. Practice
*   **[Daily Routine](./2_practice/daily_routine.md):** The 15-15-15 framework for working families.
*   **[Facilitator's Cookbook](./2_practice/facilitator_cookbook.md):** How to guide curiosity without teaching.
*   **[Daily Sparks Library](./2_practice/daily_sparks_library.md):** 50+ prompts to launch your first conjecture.

### 3. Implementation
*   **[Refinement Log Template](./3_implementation/refinement_log_template.md):** The primary tool for tracking progress.
*   **[Technical Setup](./3_implementation/technical_setup.md):** Building your offline "Safe Harbor" server.
*   **[30-Day Quickstart](./3_implementation/quickstart_30_day.md):** A roadmap for your first month.

## Getting Started

1.  **Read [The Pitch](./1_philosophy/the_pitch.md)** to understand the "Why."
2.  **Pick a [Daily Spark](./2_practice/daily_sparks_library.md)** and launch a conjecture at breakfast.
3.  **Print the [Refinement Log](./3_implementation/refinement_log_template.md)** to start capturing knowledge creation.
