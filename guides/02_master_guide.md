# The CETR Master Guide: Quick Start

Most kids are bored because they are treated like **empty buckets**. In CETR, we treat kids like **Knowledge Creators**. 

When your child gets curious, don't teach—**facilitate** using this 4-step loop.

## 1. The Cycle (C-E-T-R)

1.  **Conjecture (The Guess):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "That’s a great mystery! What is your **boldest guess** as to why that happens?"
2.  **Explanation (The Why):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "How does your guess work in detail? What is the **mechanism** inside?"
3.  **Testing (The Check):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "How could we prove your guess **wrong**? What experiment can we run?"
4.  **Refinement (The Upgrade):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "Now that we saw the test, how can we **improve** your idea?"

## 2. The Two Golden Rules

### Rule #1: Facts vs. Mysteries
*   **Facts (Just tell them):** "What is the capital of Japan?" -> **Tokyo.** (Don't make them guess arbitrary labels).
*   **Mysteries (Use CETR):** "Why do people live in cities?" -> **Investigate.** (This is a puzzle about resources and safety).

### Rule #2: Be the "Critic of Ideas," Not the Child
Never say "That's a dumb idea." Say "That is a bold conjecture! How can we check if it's true?" Your job is to help them find their own mistakes.

## 3. The 80/20 Daily Split

*   **The 20% - "Bricks" (Morning, 30 mins):** 
    Memorize the basics that can't be "discovered" (Alphabet, Times Tables, Vocab). Use flashcards and drills.
*   **The 80% - "Castles" (Afternoon, 1-2 hours):** 
    This is the **C-E-T-R** loop. Apply it to Science, History, Engineering, or anything they are curious about.

## 4. Why This Works
*   **Confidence:** They learn they can solve *any* problem.
*   **Google-Proof:** They don't just "look things up"; they understand them deeply.
*   **Resilience:** They stop being afraid of being wrong. In CETR, being wrong is just "deleting a mistake."

**The Goal: Don't just give them a map. Give them the tools to build their own.**
