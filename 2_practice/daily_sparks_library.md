### How to use these Sparks:
1.  **Pick one** during breakfast or on a walk.
2.  **Ask for a Conjecture:** "What's your boldest guess?"
3.  **Encourage Detail:** "How would that work in detail?"
4.  **Do NOT give the answer.** If they get stuck, go to the **Offline Library** together.

**Goal:** The goal isn't to get the "correct" answer by the end of the day. The goal is to practice the **Cycle of Refinement.**
