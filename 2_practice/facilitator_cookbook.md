# The Facilitator's Cookbook: Guiding Knowledge Creation

As a CETR facilitator, your goal is not to transmit knowledge, but to guide the child in creating their own.

## 1. The 4-Step Loop (C-E-T-R)

1.  **Conjecture (The Guess):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "That’s a great mystery! What is your **boldest guess** as to why that happens?"
2.  **Explanation (The Why):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "How does your guess work in detail? What is the **mechanism** inside?"
3.  **Testing (The Check):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "How could we prove your guess **wrong**? What experiment can we run?"
4.  **Refinement (The Upgrade):** 
    *   *Prompt:* "Now that we saw the test, how can we **improve** your idea?"

## 2. The 5 "Power Questions"

Keep these in your pocket for every interaction:
1.  **"What's your Conjecture?"** (Instead of "What's the answer?")
2.  **"How does that work in detail?"** (Pushes for a "hard-to-vary" explanation)
3.  **"How could we prove that idea wrong?"** (Sets up the test)
4.  **"What does your idea assume?"** (Uncovers hidden theories)
5.  **"Based on that test, how should we refine our guess?"** (The error-correction step)

## 3. General Principles

### You ARE:
*   **A critic of ideas:** Focus on the idea, not the child. Help them find the flaws in their conjectures.
*   **A guide for designing tests:** Work *with* the child to devise experiments.
*   **A model of rational thinking:** Demonstrate curiosity and the willingness to be wrong.

### You ARE NOT:
*   A lecturer transmitting facts.
*   An authority judging correctness.
*   A "cheerleader" for every answer (praise the *process* of error correction instead).

## 4. Handling Roadblocks

*   **"I don't know" / Silence:**
    *   "That's okay! What's the wildest, silliest guess you can make?" (Encourage conjecture)
    *   "What's one thing we could try, even if it might be wrong?" (Encourage testing)
*   **"This is boring" / Frustration:**
    *   Search for a **Common Preference** (TCS). Perhaps the problem isn't interesting to them right now. Find a different "Spark."
*   **"Is this the right answer?":**
    *   "I don't know! How could we check with the Offline Library to see if it's a good explanation?" (Shift authority to reality).

## 5. The Golden Rules
*   **Facts vs. Mysteries:** Just tell them arbitrary facts (e.g., "The word for this is 'Gravity'"). Use CETR for *why* things happen.
*   **Consent over Coercion:** If the child is forced, their critical engine shuts down. If it's not fun, it's not working.
*   **Celebrate the Error:** A failed test is a successful discovery of an error.

**The ultimate arbiter of truth is reality, not the facilitator.**
