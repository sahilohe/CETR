# The Minimum Viable Day: A Practical Schedule for Working Families

One of the biggest misconceptions is that Sovereign Learning requires 8 hours of "teaching." In reality, CETR is about **high-intensity, low-duration** intellectual bursts followed by **autonomous exploration.**

### The "15-15-15" Framework
*Total parent engagement: 45 minutes.*

#### 1. The Morning Spark (15 Minutes) - **The Conjecture**
*   **When:** During breakfast.
*   **Goal:** Launch a problem.
*   **Action:** Present a "Daily Spark" (e.g., "Why does it get colder as we go up a mountain if we are closer to the sun?").
*   **Facilitator Role:** Listen to their "wild guesses." Do NOT correct them. Simply ask: *"How would that work in detail?"*
*   **Outcome:** The child has a "Conjecture" to chew on for the day.

#### 2. The Mid-Day Autonomy (Asynchronous) - **The Testing**
*   **When:** While you are working / Child is in the Studio.
*   **Goal:** Research and Play.
*   **Action:** The child uses the **Offline Library (Kiwix)** or the **Maker Studio** to test their theory. 
*   **Facilitator Role:** None. The child is a "Sovereign Explorer."
*   **Tools:** Kiwix (Wikipedia/Khan), Maker materials, Local Socratic LLM.

#### 3. The Evening Refinement (15 Minutes) - **The Error Correction**
*   **When:** Over dinner.
*   **Goal:** Celebrate the "Refutation."
*   **Action:** Ask: *"What did you find today that proved your morning guess was wrong?"*
*   **Facilitator Role:** Be the "Judge." Help them connect the new data to a better explanation.
*   **Outcome:** A refined theory and a sense of progress.

### Why This Works for Parents
1.  **Zero Prep:** You don't need a lesson plan. You just need a good question (The Spark).
2.  **Productivity:** You can do your deep work while they do their "Deep Learning."
3.  **Connection:** Your time with them is spent on interesting ideas, not "compliance" (nagging them to do worksheets).

### The "Wednesday Pivot" (A Variation)
Sometimes a child gets obsessed with one problem for a whole week. That's a feature, not a bug. 
*   **Mon-Tue:** Conjecture & Research.
*   **Wed:** The "Hard Refutation" (They realize their idea is totally wrong).
*   **Thu-Fri:** Building the "New Explanation."

**Consistency > Duration.** 15 minutes of genuine CETR is better than 5 hours of coerced schooling.
