# Edventures Studio Quickstart: Implementing CETR + TCS

This guide provides a high-impact, low-friction roadmap for integrating the **CETR + TCS** ecosystem into an Edventures Studio residency.

## Part 1: The Facilitator's "Pocket" Cheat Sheet
*Keep these 5 principles and 5 questions in mind during every interaction.*

### The 5 "Golden Rules" (TCS)
1.  **Consent over Coercion:** If they don't want to do it, don't force it. Find a "Common Preference" instead.
2.  **No Authority over Logic:** "Because I said so" is banned. Let reality/logic be the judge.
3.  **Celebrate the Error:** A failed test is a successful discovery of an error.
4.  **Ideas are Fair Game; People are Sacred:** Criticize the *conjecture* relentlessly, but never the *child*.
5.  **Stop the Download:** Never give an answer when a question could help them find it.

### The 5 "Power Questions" (CETR)
1.  **"What's your Conjecture?"** (Instead of "What's the answer?")
2.  **"How does that work in detail?"** (Pushes for a "hard-to-vary" explanation)
3.  **"How could we prove that idea wrong?"** (Sets up the test)
4.  **"What does your idea assume?"** (Uncovers hidden theories)
5.  **"Based on that test, how should we refine our guess?"** (The error-correction step)

## Part 2: 30-Day Studio Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Cultural Vocabulary & "The Refinement Fair"
*   **Goal:** Normalize the language of Critical Rationalism.
*   **Action 1:** Introduce the words "Conjecture" and "Refinement" into the morning circle.
*   **Action 2:** Replace the Friday "Show and Tell" with the **Refinement Fair**. 
    *   *Requirement:* Every child must present one thing they got "wrong" and how they improved it.
*   **Action 3:** Hang the "5 Power Questions" on the Studio wall.

### Week 2: Technical "Safe Harbor" (The Server)
*   **Goal:** Provide a distraction-free, high-quality research environment.
*   **Action 1:** Set up a **Kiwix Server** on a local Mini-PC/Raspberry Pi.
    *   *Content:* Wikipedia (Full), Khan Academy, Wiktionary, curated science videos.
*   **Action 2:** Introduce "Library Time" where kids use the offline search to find evidence for their conjectures.
*   **Action 3:** (Optional) Deploy a local LLM (Ollama) with a Socratic system prompt.

### Week 3: "Epistemic Expeditions"
*   **Goal:** Turn movement and exploration into knowledge creation.
*   **Action 1:** Before any field trip/adventure, hold a **15-minute Conjecture Session**.
    *   *Prompt:* "We are going to a rubber plantation. What's your conjecture on how they get the liquid out of the tree? Why?"
*   **Action 2:** During the trip, kids act as "Error Hunters," looking for things that prove their conjectures wrong.
*   **Action 3:** Debrief at the Studio: "Who found an error in their theory today?"

### Week 4: "Hard-to-Vary" Maker Challenges
*   **Goal:** Add intellectual rigor to the Maker Studio.
*   **Action 1:** Set a "Mystery Problem" in the maker space (e.g., "Keep an ice cube from melting for 2 hours").
*   **Action 2:** Before building, the child must draw/explain their **Mechanism**.
*   **Action 3:** Peer Review: Other kids try to find logical flaws in the explanation *before* the build begins.

## Part 3: Success Metrics for the Studio
How do you know it's working?
*   [ ] Children are using the word "Conjecture" unprompted.
*   [ ] "I don't know" is followed by "Let me make a guess."
*   [ ] A child is excited when an experiment fails because they "found the error."
*   [ ] There is a noticeable decrease in children asking for "permission" or "the right answer."
*   [ ] The Offline Library is the first place kids go when they have a disagreement about facts.
