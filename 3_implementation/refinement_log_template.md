# The CETR Refinement Log: A Record of Knowledge Creation

*Use this template to track your journey from a wild guess to a hard-to-vary explanation.*

---

**Problem Name:** __________________________________________________
**Date Started:** _______________

### 1. The Initial Conjecture (The Guess)
*Write down your first idea. No matter how wild!*
> "I think that..."
> 
> **Why? (Initial Explanation):**
> __________________________________________________________________

### 2. The Search for Errors (The Testing)
*What did you do to see if you were wrong? (Offline Library, Experiment, Interview)*
*   [ ] Search Offline Wikipedia
*   [ ] Build a Prototype
*   [ ] Ask the Socratic LLM
*   [ ] Observation in Nature

**The "Aha!" Moment:**
*What evidence did you find that contradicted your initial guess?*
> "I realized that [X] couldn't be true because [Evidence]..."

### 3. The Refinement (The Pivot)
*How has your idea changed based on what you found?*
> "My new and better explanation is..."

### 4. The "Hard-to-Vary" Test
*Could you change a part of your explanation without ruining the whole thing?*
*If it's "Hard-to-Vary," you've created real knowledge!*

### Parent/Facilitator Note:
This log is not a "test." It is a **Discovery Journal.** Save these in a binder. At the end of a residency, this binder is the "Portfolio of a Sovereign Learner"—proof that the child knows how to think, not just what to think.
