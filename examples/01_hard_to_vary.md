# Hard-to-Vary: Rigid Examples of CETR in Worldschooling

A "hard-to-vary" explanation is one where every detail plays a functional role. If you change a detail, the explanation no longer works. These examples show how Worldschooling provides the "Testing" ground for such explanations.

## 1. The "Fortress of Shade" (Architecture & Physics)
**Location:** Seville, Spain (Ancient Mediterranean/Arabic Cities)
**Problem:** Why are the streets in the old quarter narrow and winding, while modern streets are wide and straight?

*   **Weak (Easy-to-Vary) Explanation:** "They didn't have cars back then, so they didn't need room."
    *   *Critique:* They could have still built straight, wide paths for horses and carts. Narrowness isn't a requirement of horse-drawn travel.
*   **The CETR Cycle:**
    *   **Conjecture:** Narrow streets are for defense; it’s harder for an invading army to march through them.
    *   **Testing:** Walk through a narrow street at 2:00 PM (peak sun) and then walk through a wide modern plaza. Measure the temperature or observe the light levels on the pavement.
    *   **Refinement (The Hard-to-Vary Explanation):** The streets are **"Urban Canyons of Shade."** In a pre-AC era, the street width was precisely calculated so that buildings cast shadows on the pavement for 90% of the day. The "windings" prevent the sun from ever "lining up" with the street.
*   **Why it’s Rigid:** If you make the street wider, the shade disappears. If you make it straight, the sun eventually bakes the whole path. The geometry is a functional response to the solar angle.

## 2. The "Island Flightless" Mystery (Evolutionary Biology)
**Location:** The Galápagos Islands or New Zealand
**Problem:** Why did birds like the Cormorant or Kiwi lose the ability to fly, despite flight being a massive survival advantage?

*   **Weak (Easy-to-Vary) Explanation:** "They got lazy because there is plenty of food on the ground."
    *   *Critique:* Flying would still help them find food faster or escape a storm. "Laziness" isn't a biological mechanism.
*   **The CETR Cycle:**
    *   **Conjecture:** They "forgot" how to fly because they didn't need to practice.
    *   **Testing:** Search the local environment for native terrestrial predators (foxes, cats, wolves).
    *   **Refinement (The Hard-to-Vary Explanation):** Flight is **metabolically expensive.** Maintaining large pectoral muscles and high-energy wings requires massive calorie intake. In an environment with **zero terrestrial predators**, the "cost" of flight outweighs the "benefit." Evolution "prunes" the wings to redirect that energy into size, armor, or reproduction.
*   **Why it’s Rigid:** It’s a mathematical trade-off. If you introduce a single predator (like a stray cat), the explanation predicts the immediate extinction of the species—which is exactly what we observe in island ecologies.

## 3. The "Salt-City" Wealth (Economics & Geology)
**Location:** Hallstatt, Austria or Salzburg
**Problem:** Why is there a massive, ornate cathedral and a wealthy village in such a remote, inaccessible mountain location?

*   **Weak (Easy-to-Vary) Explanation:** "The people who lived here really liked the mountain view."
    *   *Critique:* People don't build multi-million dollar stone cathedrals in 800 AD just for a view; the logistics are too punishing.
*   **The CETR Cycle:**
    *   **Conjecture:** There must be a gold mine hidden in the mountains.
    *   **Testing:** Explore the local mines. Is it gold? No, it’s Halite (Salt).
    *   **Refinement (The Hard-to-Vary Explanation):** Before refrigeration, **Salt was the only way to "stop time"** (preserve meat). This made salt the "White Gold" of the Middle Ages. The town’s wealth is the direct result of a geological "salt pipe" formed by a receding prehistoric ocean trapped under the Alps.
*   **Why it’s Rigid:** If the salt wasn't there, the town couldn't exist. The cost of hauling stone up a mountain is only "paid for" by the high value-density of a preservative that an entire continent needs to survive the winter.

## Summary for Facilitators
When running CETR during travel, push for the **Constraint**. 
1.  Identify the **Problem** (Heat, Predation, Preservation).
2.  Propose a **Solution** (Conjecture).
3.  Show why **any other solution** would fail to solve the problem (Hard-to-Vary).
