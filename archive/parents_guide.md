# CETR: A Simple Guide for Parents

Most school systems treat kids like empty buckets to be filled with facts. **CETR is different.** 

We treat kids like **little scientists** who create their own knowledge.

## What is CETR?
It stands for four simple steps that happen every time your child gets curious:

1. **C - Conjecture (The Guess):** Let them make a wild guess about how something works. 
   - *Example:* "I think the moon follows us because it likes us."
2. **E - Explanation (The Why):** Ask them *why* they think that.
   - *Example:* "It moves whenever we move, so it must be watching us."
3. **T - Testing (The Check):** Find a way to see if the guess is right.
   - *Example:* "Let's stand still. Does the moon stop? Let's have Dad move while we stay here. What does he see?"
4. **R - Refinement (The Upgrade):** Change the guess based on what happened.
   - *Example:* "The moon is so far away that it *looks* like it's moving with us, but it's actually just staying in one spot."
5. **P - Publish (The Show & Tell):** The most important step! They must explain their new idea to someone else (Grandma, a friend, or even the dog).
   - *Why:* If they can't explain it simply, they don't understand it yet.

## Two Golden Rules for Parents

### Rule #1: Facts vs. Mysteries
Don't be a generic robot. know when to answer and when to ask.
*   **The "Fact" Question:** "What is the capital of France?" -> **Just tell them.** (It's Paris. There is nothing to "discover" here.)
*   **The "Mystery" Question:** "Why do cities grow where they do?" -> **Use CETR.** (This is a puzzle to solve about rivers, trade, and defense.)

### Rule #2: Be the "Co-Explorer"
You don't need to be an expert. In fact, it's better if you aren't!

*   **Stop giving answers:** If they ask "Why is the sky blue?", don't Google it immediately. Ask: "That’s a great question. What’s your best guess?"
*   **Celebrate being wrong:** In CETR, finding out you were wrong is a **win**. It means you just deleted a mistake and got closer to the truth.
*   **Be the Critic of Ideas, not the Child:** Never say "That's a dumb idea." Say "How could we test if that idea is true?"

## The "Daily Spark"
Every day, we give the child one "Spark"—a weird question or a small problem. 
- "Why do mirrors flip left-to-right but not up-to-down?"
- "How would you build a house on Mars?"

The goal isn't to get the "right" answer. The goal is to start the **C → E → T → R** cycle.

## Why do this?
*   **No more "Google Brain":** Kids learn to think for themselves instead of just memorizing what a screen tells them.
*   **Confidence:** They learn that they can solve hard problems by trial and error.
*   **Resilience:** They stop being afraid of making mistakes.

**Remember: Don't teach. Just help them wonder.**
