# The "Rapid Fire" Module: Building the Toolkit

CETR is for **understanding the world**. But you can't build a house without bricks.

This module is about collecting the bricks—the raw facts, vocabulary, and skills your child needs to make great conjectures later.

## Why Do We Need This?
You can't "discover" the alphabet. You can't "guess" that 7 x 8 = 56. These are conventions we agreed upon. Trying to use CETR for everything will drive you both crazy.

## The Strategy: "Download Mode"
Think of this like installing software updates. It should be fast, high-energy, and separate from deep thinking time.

### 1. Identify "Arbitrary Knowledge"
If the answer is "Because we said so" (e.g., spelling rules, names of days, historical dates), **do not use CETR.** Use "Download Mode."

### 2. The Tools
*   **Flashcards (Anki):** Spaced repetition is the most efficient way to memorize facts. 10 minutes a day beats 1 hour of "studying."
*   **Mnemonics & Songs:** Catchy tunes for multiplication tables or grammar rules stick forever.
*   **Copywork:** Writing out great sentences teaches grammar and style by osmosis.

### 3. The Goal: Automaticity
We want these skills to be **automatic** so the brain is free for the hard stuff.
*   *Bad:* Spending 5 minutes sounding out "t-h-e".
*   *Good:* Reading "the" instantly so you can think about the story.

## How It Fits with CETR
*   **Morning:** 20 minutes of "Rapid Fire" (Math facts, Spelling, Vocabulary).
*   **Afternoon:** 2 hours of Deep CETR (Science, History, Projects).

**The more "bricks" they have in their toolkit, the bigger the castles they can build.**
