# The CETR Solution: A Better Way to Learn

## Meet CETR:
*   **C**onjecture
*   **E**xplanation
*   **T**esting
*   **R**efinement

## The Core Idea:
Instead of being passive consumers of information, **children become active creators of knowledge.**

They learn by:
1.  Coming up with their own ideas ("conjectures").
2.  Trying to explain them.
3.  Testing them against reality.
4.  Improving them based on feedback.

**The Goal:** To cultivate genuine understanding, critical thinking, and intellectual independence. It's not about *what* to learn, but *how* to learn.
