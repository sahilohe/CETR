# The Problem: A Perfect Storm

## 1. Traditional Schooling: The "Empty Vessel"
*   Views children as passive buckets to be filled with facts.
*   Focuses on memorization and obedience.
*   **Fails to develop:** Critical thinking, creativity, and resilience.

## 2. The Digital Age: The "Distraction Crisis"
*   **Algorithmic Feeds (YouTube, TikTok):** Designed for addiction, not education.
*   **Infinite Scroll:** Prevents deep focus and reflection.
*   **The Result:** Shorter attention spans, passive consumption, and a decline in curiosity.

### Our children's minds are being shaped by systems that prioritize engagement over understanding.
