# Addressing the Big Question: "Won't They Fall Behind?"

## Traditional metrics (like test scores) measure the wrong thing: passive absorption.

CETR focuses on developing **meta-skills** that *accelerate* all future learning:
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts.
*   **Hypothesis Formation:** Generating creative, testable ideas.
*   **Error Correction:** Seeing mistakes as opportunities for growth, not failures.
*   **Causal Reasoning:** Understanding the "why" behind things.

### The Evidence is Clear
Decades of research (Freeman et al., 2014, PNAS) shows that **active learning consistently outperforms passive learning**, even on standardized tests.

CETR students may seem "slower" at first because they are **thinking deeply**, not just memorizing. This deep understanding provides a much stronger foundation for long-term success. They aren't just learning facts; they are learning *how to learn*.
