# Your Role: From "Teacher" to "Co-Explorer"

You don't need to be an expert in every subject. In fact, it's better if you aren't!

| Your role IS... | Your role IS NOT... |
| :--- | :--- |
| A **critic of ideas** (not the child) | A lecturer with all the answers |
| A **guide for designing tests** | An authority judging "correctness" |
| A **model of rational thinking** | A cheerleader praising everything |
| A **curious co-explorer** | A taskmaster focused on speed |

### Your most powerful questions are:
*   "What do *you* think?"
*   "Why do you think that?"
*   "How could we test that idea?"
*   "What would happen if...?"

**Your job is not to provide answers, but to ask good questions and help your child test their own ideas against reality.**
