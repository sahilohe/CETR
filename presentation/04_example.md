# How It Works: Let's Build a Tower

**Problem:** "How can we build the tallest, most stable tower?"

---

### 1. Conjecture
A child might say: **"A wider base will make it more stable!"**
*(This is a bold, testable idea.)*

---

### 2. Explanation
**"Because the weight is more spread out, so it won't tip over."**
*(The child is moving from *what* to *why*.)*

---

### 3. Testing
Let's build it!
*   Build a tower with a wide base.
*   Build a tower with a narrow base.
*   Give them a little shake. Which one stands?
*(Reality is the judge, not the parent.)*

---

### 4. Refinement
The wide-based tower was more stable, but maybe it's not *just* the width. What if we made the top too heavy?

**New idea:** "It's not just the base, but the *ratio* of the base to the height that matters!"
*(The child has discovered a more nuanced, powerful explanation.)*
