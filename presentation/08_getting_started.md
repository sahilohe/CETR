# Getting Started: A Weekend Project

This isn't a complex, expensive system. It's designed to be simple, affordable, and achievable for any motivated parent.

## You will need:
*   **Hardware:** Any basic laptop or desktop computer and a 1TB external hard drive.
*   **Software:** A handful of free, open-source tools (Kiwix, Calibre, yt-dlp).

## The Process:
1.  **Basic Setup:** A simple, step-by-step guide will walk you through the initial software installation.
2.  **Initial Download:** Download the core content for your library (Wikipedia, books, videos).
3.  **Start Exploring:** Begin with a simple problem and let your child's curiosity lead the way.

**Detailed guides and community support will be available.** The goal is to empower you, not overwhelm you.
