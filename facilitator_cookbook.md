# CETR Facilitator's Cookbook: Guiding Curiosity

This cookbook is designed to support parents and educators in their role as CETR facilitators. Remember, your goal is not to transmit knowledge, but to guide the child in creating their own.

## 1. General Facilitation Principles (Review)

As a CETR facilitator, you ARE:
*   **A critic of ideas:** Focus on the idea, not the child. Help them find the flaws in their conjectures.
*   **A guide for designing tests:** Work *with* the child to devise experiments or ways to test their ideas against reality.
*   **A model of rational thinking:** Demonstrate curiosity, open-mindedness, and logical reasoning.
*   **A co-explorer:** You are learning alongside the child. Embrace genuine curiosity.

You ARE NOT:
*   A lecturer transmitting knowledge.
*   An authority judging correctness.
*   A cheerleader praising everything (focus on the *process* of learning, not just "good answers").
*   One who corrects by authority or shuts down ideas prematurely.

**Key Principle:** The ultimate arbiter of truth is reality itself, not the facilitator.

## 2. Crafting Effective Questions: Moving from Description to Explanation

The art of facilitation lies in asking questions that encourage deeper thinking, explanation, and testability.

### Good Facilitator Questions (General)
*   "What does your idea assume?"
*   "How would this work in detail?"
*   "What would have to be true for this to work?"
*   "How could we test that?"
*   "What might happen if your idea is wrong?"
*   "Can you think of another way it might work?"

### Daily Spark Questions (Examples)
*   "What makes a rainbow appear?"
*   "How does a seed grow into a plant?"
*   "Why does a boat float, but a rock sinks?"
*   "If you could design a new animal, what unique abilities would it have and why?"
*   "Why do we have different seasons?"

### Domain-Specific Question Prompts

#### Mathematics
*   **Problem Example:** "Invent a new way to represent fractions."
*   **Facilitator Questions:**
    *   "What makes your new system work for halves? What about thirds?"
    *   "How would someone *else* use your system to understand a fraction?"
    *   "Can your system represent *any* fraction, or are there limits?"
    *   "What if we need to add fractions using your method?"

#### Physics
*   **Problem Example:** "Design the tallest stable tower you can build."
*   **Facilitator Questions:**
    *   "What makes a structure stable? What makes it unstable?"
    *   "How does the material you use affect stability?"
    *   "What if we tested your tower on a shaky surface?"
    *   "Can you think of a real-world building that uses principles of stability?"

#### Biology
*   **Problem Example:** "Why do some plants have thorns?"
*   **Facilitator Questions:**
    *   "What problem do thorns solve for the plant?"
    *   "What evidence would tell us if your idea about thorns is correct?"
    *   "Do all plants have thorns? What about plants that *don't* have them?"
    *   "Could thorns have any disadvantages for the plant?"

#### Computer Science
*   **Problem Example:** "Create an algorithm that sorts a list of numbers."
*   **Facilitator Questions:**
    *   "How does your algorithm know which number is 'smallest'?"
    *   "What happens if the list is already sorted? Does it still work efficiently?"
    *   "Can you describe your algorithm step-by-step so a computer could understand it?"
    *   "What if the list had a million numbers? Would your method still be fast?"

## 3. Handling Roadblocks: When the Child Gets Stuck

It's natural for children to get stuck or say "I don't know." These are moments for growth.

*   **"I don't know" / Silence:**
    *   "That's okay! What's the wildest guess you can make?" (Encourage conjecture)
    *   "What's the *easiest* part of the problem you *do* understand?" (Break down the problem)
    *   "Let's look for clues in our library. Where might we find information about this?" (Guide research)
    *   "What's one thing we could try, even if it might be wrong?" (Encourage testing)
*   **"This is boring" / Frustration:**
    *   "What part of it is boring? What would make it more interesting for you?" (Find their intrinsic motivation)
    *   "Perhaps we need a new problem, or a different way to look at this one." (Offer a change of pace or perspective)
    *   "Remember, making mistakes and figuring things out is the fun part!" (Reframe difficulty)

## 4. Leveraging the Local LLM for Socratic Support

The local LLM is a powerful tool, but it must be used correctly to align with CETR principles.
**NEVER ask the LLM for direct answers.** Instead, prompt it to act as a Socratic tutor.

### Example Prompts for the LLM
*   "Act as a Socratic tutor for a 10-year-old learning about [topic]. Ask questions that encourage them to form their own conjectures and explanations. Do not give direct answers. If they provide an explanation, ask 'Why do you think that?' or 'How could we test that?'"
*   "I am discussing [problem] with a child. The child believes [conjecture]. What question could I ask them to help them test this idea?"
*   "The child just said [explanation]. What's a good follow-up question to push for deeper explanation or identify assumptions?"
*   "Given the context of our offline library about [topic], if a child asks 'What is X?', how would you respond in a way that encourages them to conjecture and explain, without giving them the answer directly?"

By using the LLM in this way, you reinforce the CETR framework and prevent it from becoming a simple answer-machine.
