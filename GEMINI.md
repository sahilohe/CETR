# CETR + TCS + Edventures Studio Project Context

This project is about building a holistic learning ecosystem called **CETR + TCS + Edventures Studio**. It is based on the ideas of critical rationalism from Deutsch and Popper, and its application to homeschooling.

It integrates three core pillars:
1.  **CETR (Conjecture, Explanation, Testing, Refinement):** A learning framework for knowledge creation.
2.  **TCS (Taking Children Seriously):** A non-coercive philosophy for parenting and education.
3.  **Edventures Studio:** The practical implementation and community aspect for maker-spaces and worldschooling.

The goal of this project is to develop an entirely new learning ecosystem for kids. The user intends to use this space to discuss, receive critiques, and continuously improve these frameworks.
