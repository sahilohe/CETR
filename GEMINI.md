# CETR Project Context

This project is about building a learning framework called CETR. It is based on the ideas of critical rationalism from Deutsch and Popper, and its application to homeschooling.

CETR stands for:
*   **C** - Conjecture
*   **E** - Explanations
*   **T** - Testing
*   **R** - Refinement

The goal of this project is to develop an entirely new learning framework for kids. The user intends to use this space to discuss, receive critiques, and continuously improve the CETR framework.
